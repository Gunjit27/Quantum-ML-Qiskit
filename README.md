# Quantum-ML-Qiskit

This repository contains end-to-end experiments applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models to real-world datasets using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). The notebook explores both classical machine learning baselines and advanced quantum models like Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs).

## ðŸ“– Introduction

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) leverages the principles of quantum computing to enhance classical machine learning algorithms. This project explores the use of Qiskit's Machine Learning module to implement models such as Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs).

The goal is to compare the performance of quantum-enhanced models with traditional machine learning techniques.
